== Congratulations on finishing the Quarkus Workshop

This workshop gave you an introduction to Quarkus and how to tackle common use cases with it.

You also got to try out the Developer Sandbox and different capabilities of OpenShift and other related projects for running modern applications.

If you want to dig deeper into Quarkus there are plenty of documentation and guides at http://quarkus.io[quarkus.io^] as well in Red Hats documentation for https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/[Quarkus^]

There are also other interactive learning paths as well as interesting blog posts and free e-books around Java and Quarkus at https://developers.redhat.com/learn/java[Red Hat Developers - Java^]
